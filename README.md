# Example App Backend

This is a really simple Java webapp that you can use to test Paymentez [example iOS apps](https://github.com/paymentez/paymentez-ios-example) and
[example Android apps](https://github.com/paymentez/paymentez-android-example).

This is intended for example purposes only: you'll likely need something more serious for your production apps.

## Deploying to Heroku

Then set the `BACKEND_URL` variable in our example apps to your Heroku URL (it'll be in the format https://my-example-app.herokuapp.com).

Happy testing!
